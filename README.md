App that allows you to scroll through list of friends (in this case Game of Thrones characters), each with a name and profile picture.
When clicked on a specific friend, the app will open their profile, which includes their profile pic, name, bio, and rating. 
When rating a friend, the app will remember the rating and show this rating the next time the user opens that friend's profile.
